CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findkobuki_ros_interfaces.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "kobuki_ros_interfaces", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "kobuki_ros_interfaces" with any of the following names:

    kobuki_ros_interfacesConfig.cmake
    kobuki_ros_interfaces-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "kobuki_ros_interfaces" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "kobuki_ros_interfaces_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "kobuki_ros_interfaces" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
